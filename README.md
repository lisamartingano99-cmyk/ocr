# ocr
A place to put all our ocr practice stuff

## Instructions

1. Use [kraken](https://kraken.re/main/index.html) (or Transkribus) to produce an OCRed text and turn that into a TEI document.
2. Make a folder with your name and put in all the stuff you made. 
3. Create a `your_name.html` by copying mine.
4. Edit the requisite parts of `your_name.html` to point toward your TEI file: `./your_name/your_name.xml`
5. DO NOT edit `index.html`. It will regenerate automatically.
6. Commit, push, PR
