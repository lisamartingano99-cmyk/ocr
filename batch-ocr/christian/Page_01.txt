Men with writing proficiency enjoyed a privileged position in ancient Egyptian society in the third
millennium BC. Research focusing on these officials of elevated social status ('scribes'') usually
concentrates on their titles, scribal statues, iconography, etc., but the individuals themselves, and
their skeletal remains, have been neglected. The aim of this study is to reveal whether repetitive
tasks and maintained postures related to scribal activity can manifest in skeletal changes and identify
possible occupational risk factors. A total of 1767 items including entheseal changes, non-metric
traits, and degenerative changes were recorded from the human remains of 69 adult males of well-
defined social status categories from the necropolis at Abusir (2700-2180 BC). Statistically significant
differences between the scribes and the reference group attested a higher incidence of changes in
scribes and manifested themselves especially in the occurrence of osteoarthritis of the joints. Our
research reveals that remaining in a cross-legged sitting or kneeling position for extended periods, and
the repetitive tasks related to writing and the adjusting of the rush pens during scribal activity, caused
the extreme overloading of the jaw, neck and shoulder regions.
Ihe term ``scribes'' in relation to ancient Egypt in the third millennium BC covers men who held a wide range
of administrative posts or functions. These individuals enjoyed a privileged position in society at that time,
since only 1%6 of the population would have been literate'. A whole range of scribal titles associated with vari-
ous departments or specific tasks is attested in the Old Kingdom', but literacy and writing skills/scribal ability
were an integral part of the employment ofall administrative officials. Depending upon their hierarchical grade
within a given office, it is supposed that the working activity of such officials in large part encompassed activities
related to the writing of administrative documents. Ihose who headed a department (overseers) also managed
its relevant agenda.
In recent years, scholars have directed their research towards various aspects associated with scribes, e.g-.
with their titles, scribal statues, iconography in wall decoration, writing materials, w riting systems and analyses
of single documents''. However, thorough research into the skeletal remains of these ancient Egyptian scribes,
focusing on scribal activities and their possible influence on the development of activity-related skeletal changes,
has been missing or limited to single case studies'.
Various skeletal markers manifesting on the human skeleton are supposed to be activity-induced in nature,
and reflect a mechanical loading and repetitive tasks throughout life; and vice versa specific occupational physi-
cal activities may represent risk factors for the development of various changes to the skeleton. These include in
particular the presence and character of entheseal changes (EC) at the insertion sites of tendons and ligaments`
or the size of muscle attachment sites'; selected non-metric traits (NMT) as accessory facets, notches, etc., on
the infra-cranial skeleton'"'; degenerative changes, specifically osteoarthritis (OA) of joints of appendicular
skeleton and vertebral column and intervertebral disc disease (IDD) at vertebral bodiesl2'; and analysis of the
cross-sectional geometric propertiesl%l
In addition to the presumed effects of physical stress on the development of changes, more factors such as
age, sex, metabolic disorders, or hormonal and genetic influences contribute to their aetiology. IThe link between
physical activity and skeletal changes is still not entirely clear and is widely discussed2%-' also applies to
osteoarthritic changesl%', A clear association between degenerative changes and activity thus cannot easily be
