Figure 3. Comparison of the incidence of osteoarthritis (OA) in the temporomandibular joint (TM) and the
apophyseal joints of the vertebrae (C1-S1) between scribes and the reference group (OA for the whole joint/
vertebra was scored as present if OA occurred in at least one articular surface of an apophyseal joint). Ihe
number of individuals with OA (presence of OA/total number of individuals evaluated) is shown in the table
below the graph.

Figure 4. Drawing indicating the most affected regions of the skeletons of scribes with higher prevalence of
evaluated changes compared to reference group: both temporomandibular joints (OA); cervical spine (OA,
spondylosis); right shoulder (OA of the acromial facet of the clavicle and humeral head, EC on the greater
tubercle of the humerus); right first metacarpal bone (OA); left ischial tuberosity (EC); right femoral medial
condyle (OA) and the medial squatting facet on the right talus. Drawing olana Malitkovi.
manifestations are worth mentioning. All cervical vertebrae show more degenerative changes in the scribes
compared to the reference group, but the statistically significant differences concern mainly OA at the apophyseal
joints. The C7 vertebra exhibited the highest incidence of OA changes at apophyseal joints among the cervical
vertebrae, and significantly exceeded the frequency in the reference sample and frequencies recorded in previous
studies. IThe location of the C7 vertebra at a point where the lordotic curvature of the cervical spine ends and the
thoracic kyphosis begins implies that the lower facets are under continuous tension, partially due to the action
of the nuchal ligament that ends at the spinous process of the C72'. Ihe C7 vertebra is thus usually one of the
most affected vertebrae in OA'%. This explains the frequent occurrence of OA at the C7 vertebra, but not the
enormous increase in OA in scribes compared to the reference group. It cannot be ruled out that this could be
related to the constant overloading of the cervical spine.
