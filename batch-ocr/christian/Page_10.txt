In a typical scribes working position, the head had to be forward, and the spine flexed, changing the centre of
gravity of the head and putting stress on the spine. An exaggerated dorsal kyphosis (round back) places the head
ahead of the centre of gravity, increasing the cervical lordosis. The weight of the head in this position is borne
by the apophyseal joints'. The forward head posture with a flexed neck is a position characteristic of many of
modern occupations. In a sitting work position characterized by flexion of the whole spine to accommodate the
eye-object distance to a horizontal working surface (as with scribes), the load moment for the C7-T1 motion
segment induced by the weight of the head and neck increases 3.6 times in comparison to the neutral position''.
Prolonged cross-legged sitting could result in a significant increase of degenerative changes to the cervical spine
among scribes.
Atypical and excessive loading of the cervical spine in the group of scribes is also accompanied by the extreme
prevalence of OA in the temporomandibular joint (TM). Ihe prevalence of TM OA ranges from 16%96 to 38%6 in
living populations and from 2.4%6 to 40%6 in archaeological samples''-, The prevalence of TM OA in individuals
in the reference sample (30%6) falls exactly within this range. However, the temporomandibular joints of the
scribes were affected far beyond the reported incidence of TM OA in previous studies (64%6). IThe development
of TM OA is most commonly associated with dental pathologies, dental attrition or antemortem tooth loss of
the posterior dentition`' or with dietary habite''. The significant loading of the TM could also be closely related
directly to scribal activity. IThe tools that scribes used to write were made from rush (uncus), which was cut ata
slant and chewed at the end to form a brush-like head''. When the pen became ragged or clogged with ink, the
scribe cut off the end again and chewed the next section. Frequent or long-term chewing may be a risk factor for
TM disorders with a high percentages of osteoarthritis'. This scribal habit of retting by chewing the rush brush
used to write hieroglyphs might also have led to the asymmetrical dental wear evidenced in the mandible of the
scribe Horemkenesi (21st Dynasty, Thebes), where it resulted in mesio-distal depressions along the molar teeth''.
However, the existing relationship between the load on the cervical spine and the temporomandibular joint
cannot be ignored. The correlation between temporomandibular disorders and cervical spine dysfunction or
neckshoulder area symptoms is well documented or reviewed by clinical studies-% The TM and cervical spine
are anatomically and functionally interrelated, and the malposition of one can affect the position and function of
the other'. Postural maintenance of the head is achieved through a muscle chain which is formed, among others,
by the large posterior neck muscles and anterior muscle attachments to the mandible and hyoid bones, as they
link the cranium to the shoulder girdle. Any alteration of this functional chain anywhere along its course will be
reflected elsewhere along its length'%. Therefore, we cannot exclude that the high incidence of TM OA among
scribes compared to the reference sample may to some extent be related to extreme overloading of the cervical
spine. While scribes probably alternated the position of the arms and leg, the head and cervical spine remained
in a forward position, resulting in excessive strain. It should be noted that in the case of the temporomandibular
joint and upper cervical vertebrae, no statistically significant differences in age distribution were found between
the scribes and the reference group. Therefore, in this case, the differences observed between the groups of
individuals evaluated are not due to differences in age distribution.
As in the case of the cervical spine and TM, statistically significant differences in the shoulder and the whole
upper limb were higher in the group of scribes for most of the studied traits. Nevertheless, statistically significant
differences were observed for only a few traits, linked mainly to OA or its minor criteria. The scribes' group
manifested a significant increase in OA changes at the right shoulder (humeral head, acromial facet of clavicle)
and the right first metacarpal bone. IThe pattern of right shoulder loading is complemented by an increased
occurrence of entheseal changes at the margin of the supra- and infraspinatus muscle attachment on the humeral
greater tubercle (HSI), which belongs to the rotator cuff group. The prevalence of shoulder osteoarthritis is usu-
ally low comparison to other large joints% The shoulder and hip are usually less severely involved than the
knee or elbow''. By contrast, among scribes the shoulder is the most affected joint compared to the hip and knee
(unlike the reference group, where it was the elbow area; Fig. 5). However, apart from the acromial facet of the
clavicle and the first metacarpal, the age distribution of the scribes differs from that of the referenee group for
the traits evaluated, with the scribes having a greater number of older individuals. The influence of age cannot
be excluded in this case.
In conjunction with the involvement of the supra- and infraspinatus muscle tendons, this could indicate an
overall overloading of the shoulder region. Stress to the rotator cuft, specifically the supraspinatus muscle, usually
occurs when the arm is in an elevated position, such as among painters'. However, it could also be related to a
static sitting position with arms unsupported, such as during typing'. Last but not least, the shoulder area is
connected to the cervical spine, both functionally and by innervation. Especially in the C7/T1 oint area, where
an enormous load was recorded among scribes, the upper girdle and vertebral column are linked'. Studies
focused on the impact of disorders in the upper quarter' of the body on posture and pain experienced in different
parts of the body have found a relationship between the presence of signs and symptoms in the jaw and neckl
shoulder areas
Based on the iconography and statues, it can be assumed that scribes wrote with their right hands and rolled
the papyrus scroll left-handed. A papyrus 6 mlength, when tightly rolled, yielded a cylinder 5-6 cm thick, which
could easily be spanned by the fingers of a hand''. Writing with a rush pen required dexterity that allowed the
creation of clearly written ligatured as well as non-ligatured signs ofl cm or less'. These repetitive movements
and positions can lead to excessive strain on the wrists and hands, which could be reflected in changes to the
bones. Occupational risk factors of the hand and wrist are however usually closely related to tendon-related
disorders (tendinitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, ete.) caused by the chronic performance of forceful exertions or
highly repetitive hand-intensive tasks'. These work-related musculoskeletal disorders are difficult to identify on
the skeleton and to interpret appropriately. As for the wrist area of the studied skeletons, only minor osteoarthritic
changes (MC, SC) exhibited a significantly higher incidence in the group of scribes, on both hands localized to
the scaphoid and lunate area. Unlike tendon-related disorders, OA of the wrist is usually traceable to a secondary
