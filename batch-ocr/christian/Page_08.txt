Figure 2. Osteoarthritis of the temporomandibular joint of a supposed family member (174/AS79/2015) of
Khemetnu, the presumed owner of family tomb AS 79. Khemetnus working activity was associated with the
household management and the arranging of the funerary cult of the judge Inti (AS 22). (A) Base of the skull

possible influence of advanced age in the scribes' group on the higher incidence of degenerative changes cannot
be completely ruled out, because for half of the traits for which statistically significant differences were found, the
distribution across age categories is not the same-scribes tend to be older. Simplistically, we can conclude that
these differences do not apply to the temporomandibular joint region, the acromial facet of the clavicle, the wrist
and metacarpus, the pelvic and talar traits, and the upper cervical and mid-thoracic spine, where the distribution
of individuals in the age categories is similar. Conversely, the observed differences in the prevalence of changes
assessed in the humerus, femur, and patella, as well as the lower cervical and lumbar spine, may be influenced by
this unequal age distribution. However, in the study presented it would be highly likely that statistically significant
differences in the incidence of degenerative changes between scribes and the reference group would occur in a
much larger number, or even the majority, of the articular surfaces assessed, rather than in a minority of them,
localised to a few regions of the skeleton. This permits the assumption that the observed differences could to
some extent be related to the scribal activity associated with well-defined repetitive tasks and stationary posture.
One of the areas significantly more affected in the group of scribes was the spine, especially in the cervical
region. Two separate areas of vertebrae were examined: (zyg)apophyseal joints with osteoarthritic changes (OA/
minor criteria) and intervertebral joints (bodies) with marginal spondylosis (SP) and surface changes (IDD).
IThe prevalence of changes in a particular vertebra is different for each marker; they are basically uncorrelated,
which is due to the different function of the apophyseal and intervertebral joints of the spine. The intervertebral
joints allow a minimum of movement and provide support, while the apophyseal joints provide less support
with varying degrees of movement.
Compared to previous studiese-2, the curves characterizing the degree of loading of individual vertebrae
in the present study approximately correspond for both scribes and the reference sample, but some atypical
