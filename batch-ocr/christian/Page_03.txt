Results
Of the 1767 evaluated items in total, a statistically significant difference at the level of significance alpha 0.05
between the scribes and the reference group based on Mann-Whitney U test and/or Chi-square test was found
in only 68 (3.85%6); 34 significant differences were recorded on the skull and appendicular skeleton and 34 on the
vertebrae. The results of the statistical analyses for these 68 traits are shown in Tables 1 and 2, separately for the
skull and appendicular skeleton, and vertebrae (the complete results for all 1767 items are given in Supplementary
Data S1 and Data S2). After adjustment using the Holm-Bonferroni correction, the number of statistically
significant traits was reduced to 40. The traits that appeared non-significant after this correction were mainly
scored on the lower limb and vertebrae. Although we recognize that the explanatory value of the differences
between the scribes and the reference group is lower for those traits that were found to be significant using only
the Mann- Whitney or chi-squared tests, we address them in the results and discussion.
IThe observed statistically significant differences indicate a higher incidence of changes in scribes compared
to the reference sample (61/68; 90%6; respective 37/40; 92.5%6 after Holm-Bonferroni correction) and manifested
themselves especially in the occurrence of degenerative changes to the joints (OA and/or minor criteria) for both
the appendicular skeleton and vertebrae.
In terms of the OA changes on the skull and appendicular skeleton in scribes, a higher incidence was observed
at the areas of both temporomandibular joints (Figs. 2, 3), the right clavicle, the right humeral caput, proximal
articular surface of the right first metacarpal bone (CMC1) and the medial condyle of the right femur (Fig. 4).
Differences in minor changes (SC, MC, C, NB) were also recorded on other joints of the appendicular skeleton
(see Table 1), almost exclusively more frequently in scribes. Only two minor osteoarthritic changes showed a
higher incidence in the reference sample: marginal changes (MC) on the right lateral surface of the patella and
the trochlea of the humerus.
As for the vertebral column, statistically significant differences of OA changes of apophyseal joints were more
common than the alterations of vertebral bodies, i.e., intervertebral disc disease (IDD;, Table 2). All significant
OA changes including the minor criteria occurred more often in scribes, except for the left upper facet of the
T2 vertebra. A higher prevalence of OA in scribes was observed especially on the cervical vertebrae (C1, C2,
C3, C7) and the T7 and L5 vertebra (Fig. 3). Minor OA changes were also noted on other vertebrae (Table 2).
Differences in the incidence of IDD were recorded only on the lower surface of the C3 vertebra and the upper
surface of the T3 vertebra, with a higher prevalence in scribes, and surface changes of the L2 upper surface in
the reference sample.
A statistically significantly higher incidence of EC in the scribes was noted at two attachment sites on the
humerus (the margin of the left entheses of the subscapularis;, HSC Out, and the right infra-/supraspinatus; HSI
Out) and on the left hip bone (ischial tuberosity), while in the reference sample only on the right femur (gluteus
maximus). In the case of vertebral bodies, EC on the inferior part of the T4 body were significantly higher in the
reference sample, while on the superior part of the L4 in scribes.
Regarding NMT, vastus fossa on the both patellae and medial squatting facet on the right talus, were recorded
more often in scribes, while a rounded edge pit on the right acetabulum was more typical for the reference sample
The results of the statistical tests did not indicate significant differences in the age-at-death
distribution between all the scribes and the reference group when all individuals evaluated were included
(' = 0.208 y'a-0.05 =- 5.991; Mann-Whitney: Z-- 0.242, p-level =-0.809). However, due to differences in the
preservation of the traits assessed, the representation of scribes and reference individuals in each age category
varies for each trait. The consistency of the distribution of individuals in the age categories was therefore
monitored separately for each trait using the Mann- Whitney U test (see last two columns of the Tables 1 and 2
for selected traits; Supplementary Data S1 and Data S2 for complete results). These results reveal a different age
distribution between scribes and the reference group for 35%6 of the traits evaluated (Supplementary Data S1
and Data S2). Traits for which we found a statistically significant difference between scribes and the reference
group show a different age distribution in half of the cases (see Table 1 and Table 2). Typically, there is a higher
number of older individuals among the scribes. The possible influence of age on the observed differences should
thus be taken into account for these traits.
All evaluated markers were tested for side asymmetry by Wilcoxon Matched Pairs Test, separately for scribes
and the reference sample. Statistically significant differences between the right and left sides were noted only for
three traits in the scribes-EC: biceps brachii insertion on the radius (N=12; T-=0.000; ZL-2.023; p-level- 0.043),
OA: mandibular fossa on the mandible (N -= 22; T-=0.000; ZL- 2.023; p-level =-0.043), NB: trochlea of humerus
(N -=20, T- 0.000; ZL -2.023; p-level- 0.043) and three traits in the reference group - EC: ischial tuberosity on
the pelvis (N-=- 18; T-=0.000; ZL-=- 2.20l1; p-level =-0.028), NMT: lateral extension of the trochlear surface on the
talus (N- 24; T-0.000, Z-2.023; p-level-0.043), SC: glenoid cavity on the scapula (N- 31, T-0.000; Z-2.201;
p-level -=-0.028).
Discussion
Professions involving scribal agenda was certainly not physically demanding, but neither can it be assumed
that individuals of lower status buried at Abusir performed physically demanding activities on a daily basis.
IThese were not labourers, but usually members of the household or relatives, performing activities related to
the running of the household?2? The similar lifestyle of the two studied samples was manifested in the low
number of evaluated traits showing statistically significant differences (3.85%), most of them showing a higher
incidence among scribes (90%6).
IThese statistically significant differences are in most cases reflected in the occurrence of degenerative joint
changes. The intensity of these traits is usually attributed to inereasing agel`l.e2%, Although the statistical tests
did not reveal any significant differences in the age-at-death distribution between the compared groups, the
