demonstrated'%', Although the multifactorial aetiology of the aforementioned skeletal markers complicates the
interpretations of the results, it seems that physical stress still remains among important factors influencing the
development and character of change, but non-mechanical factors should also be controlled or discussed%2223
When attempting to reconstruct a possible pattern of habitual activities in individuals from past populations,
the archaeological and/or historical context is crucial. For the scribes in ancient Egypt, there is evidence (textual,
wall relief decoration in tombs and statues) that provides insights into the way working activities were carried
out. Ancient Egyptian officials used a thin brush-like pen made of rush during the Pharaonic era, until it was
substituted by the Greek-origin reed pen around 100 BC. They regularly wrote on papyrus, ostraca or wooden
boards?'P. We also have a fairly accurate knowledge of the postures in which they performed their profession,
and in which they spent relatively long periods. Simplistically, it may be assumed that they mainly adopted three
typical poses: (a) the cross-legged position (sartorial), where the stretched skirt served as a table (Fig. 1A); (b) the
kneeling-squatting position, one leg squatting with the second knee on the floor (usually seen in two-dimensional
depictions; Fig. 1B '); (c) the standing position (Fig. 1C ). It is very likely that while specific positions varied
(Fig. 1D 2%), there could have been a general tendency for an individual to revert to a preferred positione'. It may
also have depended on the circumstances and the environment in which the scribal activity was carried out.
Although, these positions and movements were by no means physically demanding, it can be assumed that daily
repetition and maintaining them could affect specific areas of the skeleton.
In this paper we seek to reveal whether the repetitive tasks and positions related to scribal activity in Old King-
dom Egypt can manifest themselves in recorded changes in the skeleton, as well as which areas of the skeleton,
i.e. attachment sites or joint articular surfaces, are signihicantly affected in comparison to the reference group.
The identification of these areas, and especially their combinations, could then be useful in the identification of
the ``scribal profession'' in the skeletons of those individuals whose titles have not been preserved-a practical
outcome and the main aim of this and future research. We would also like to focus on identifying the most likely
preferred position for scribes to perform their duties, and compare it with the archaeological evidence. ITo date,
no analogous study has been published that comprehensively evaluates the occupational risk factors on the entire
skeleton, while at the same time being based on a homogenous and relatively large sample of individuals whose
employment was related to scribal activity.
